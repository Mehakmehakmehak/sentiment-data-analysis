But in the 2010s and today, using a 10 year old PC causes no issues whatsoever. Laptops followed shortly after. The same thing is happening with smartphones. In the 10 years after iPhone was released, every year brough exciting upgrades on all platforms. Phones became much faster, look much nicer, have much better screen, etc... But they peaked ~5 years ago. Their screen is near perfect, they perform all task instantaneously, so there is nothing really to improve.

UgyKb6yGz65Mw1Z-Un14AaABAg,"I am going to get a lot of hate for saying this. So I had a 21 fe which has a 120hz screen. I moved to an iPhone 13 then not Long after that coz that's what I prefer and gave the s21 fe to my gf. The iPhone which has a 60hz screen felt better than the galaxy which has a 120hz screen. Yes some android phones will most likely have better screens than that but just becoz it's higher hz doesn't mean it's definitely better than the iPhones. That being said though, I do agree that apple should include this feature on their base phones already considering how much you are paying for them already.",@mattthemightymeme,7.0,2024-10-02T15:11:15Z,mixed,True,False,,False,,True,positive,True,positive,True,negative,,

UgzpRV-A5EC9V4BhtFl4AaABAg,"Great video, very well done. Good job and thank you. It was very useful. I'm wanting to switch my wife and I back to iPhones this year, God willing, but budget is tight. Here in the EU the base 16 costs ‚Ç¨949! Very expensive. My local authorised reseller still sells the 13, 14 and 15. While the 13 and 14 are more affordable, they are a bit long in the tooth so I'm looking at the 15 potentially. Despite the drab colours (üò¢). However if we can't afford that, I'll try the 14 but sell it after a year and then get either the 15 or 16 next year when the price drops. From your tests it's clear the camera on the 15 is better in low light than the 12, 13 and 14.",@MrOrtmeier,4.0,2024-10-02T14:57:28Z,mixed,True,True,positive,False,,False,,False,,True,negative,,

UgyS1wi-a4-M4KdOBId4AaABAg,"I'm happy with 60Hz refresh. It saves on battery. I tried a 120Hz device and I said to myself afterwards: ""Meh.""

UgxfIeCiWvUe6EXzmp54AaABAg,"Will be upgrading from 12 Pro to 16 Plus. That bigger screen and the battery life is such a good plus. Is 120 Hz nice? Yes, it is. But I can live without it. I value battery life and performance over that. I just hope Apple maybe bumps it up to 75 or 90 Hz screens. That will come in handy. But there is one very important thing people are not discussing - PWM. I have noticed as a rule of thumb that every new gen has been improved. I struggled a lot on earlier OLED screens.",@kamata93,2.0,2024-10-15T04:15:52Z,positive,True,False,,True,positive,True,positive,True,mixed,False,,,
