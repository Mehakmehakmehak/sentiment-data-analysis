First the Google Voice search is not the Assistant. It is basically a Google Search with voice feature. It is not the most elegant solution to me, but a different usecase. But then, instead of just instantly talking to Gemini for the Voice Input you start Gemini Live, which is a very lightweight instantly answering no connection to anything service. It is ""just a fancy tech demo of how to talk in real time"". Gemini itself is capable of doing all these things you asked for. By either using Gemini's normal voice input, or typing the request. There it also uses a cloud based image generated, while the one in Pixel Studio is a very lightweight on the phone-ish one. Mistakes can happen, but combined with blaming lazy app ports and some other aspects it feels weirdly ""I did not like the phone and need some reasons to list"" like than the usually pretty informed way.

 Why did we move away from thick bezels if we're now introducing them virtually? Pixel 2 XL big forehead bezel comes to mind. No aesthetic alignment excuse will convince me that now we need to 'give away' screen space, which was gained through advancements in technology & the removal of thick bezels, only to reintroduce them again virtually.

UgwNRapRJlbbW4nNDj14AaABAg,"Considering the lack of a lot of the bells and whistles other flagships have including superior performance, this phone should've maintained the older pricing model to be competitive.

As a long time Pixel user, I need the Pixel 10 and onwards to solve the following:
1. Integrate Gemini and G Assistant into a seamless phone assistant that is smart in knowing when to use what. Also should work without wifi for simple tasks like setting alarms, searching files on phone, etc.
2. Get more Pixel specific features that don't come on other phones before the Pixel and also are not gimmicks like A LOT of the AI features introduced recently. Need more useful ones like Hold for Me, Screen Call, Add Me, etc.
3. Give more customization for power users/people who just want to customize.
    a. Give users the option to use a UI that actually takes advantage of the screen real-estate instead of using UI elements that take up half the page just to turn on/off airplane mode.
    b. Give users the option to revert the quick settings menu in the notification shade to actually work like actual toggles again instead of buttons that open mini-windows. Literally every other OS has this figured out including iOS. Why Google changed the behavior is beyond me.
    c. Not really a Pixel issue but Google Keep needs better features and needs more robust note-taking capabilities.
    d. Way better customization is needed akin to GoodLock on Samsung. 3rd party launchers make the phone sluggish and also ruin the seamless look of the phone.
    e. Just general customization that you would find on any 3rd party launchers. 
4. Fix the issues in the camera. 
    a. Video is still behind in Android phones in general vs iPhones. Google should take the big steps to finally improve this and lead.
    b. Fix the stuttery zoom in/out.
    c. Add higher zoom ranges for Pro models.
    d. 3rd party apps should have the same camera quality as using the camera app. This is for all Android phones. Google should whip these app devs to force them to finally get it right.
5. Flagship pricing = flagship features. That means at least 45W+ fast charging, Qi 2, SiC batteries, flagship processor, better codec support, UFS 4.0, Gorilla Armor 2, etc.
6. Treats. Add cool features that aren't a need but a nice to have like a stylus(like the galaxy ultra).

A personal one that I want Google to do is abandon glossy glass back & glossy metal siderails. Always use satin/matte back and siderails. Glossy is disgusting.

UgyXqRvAhf6syghiUZ14AaABAg,"My only complaint about my 9 Pro XL is that the corners are just too round. It cuts off part kf6 the screen that often has information there. Also, the corners aren't touch sensitive in spite of being able to see things. For example, if I'm trying to send a message in FB messenger but the keyboard is hidden so the send button is way down at the bottom left of the screen, it's hard to find just the right spot to hit the send button in spite of being able to see it. As for the rest of the features talked about, during every day usage, it's still pretty good. But Gemini definitely needs some work. It is neat to have a conversation with it like you'd talk to a person but overall it's just not that useful yet. The processor is a little lackluster but it works well and even does a great job playing games in spite of not being quite as fast as the snapdragon chips. But my 2 favorite things about this phone are the camera and the stock android experience.

UgxVPBOEiQmj_C6D9Wt4AaABAg,"My first Pixel is the Fold 9 Pro (has the same screen as the regular Pixel 9 on the outside) and i must say.  The Tensor G4 is allot to be desired. I use my Z Fold 6 in conjuction with it, and the speed difference is night and day in games. Sure if you browse the internet only, the regular pixel is a great smartphone  (at the often discounted promotions Google runs) at full price? Absolutely no. If people find themselves content with the Tensor G4, i would say we then, do not push the companies on giving us better products. Beside if the SOC is much faster,  there is a bigger chance that the phone can run certain apps in the future better and lasts longer!  Don't settle on asking Google for a more powerful Tensor SOC! I'm sick and tired of people saying the performance of that thing is enough. No is not, especially for phones costing more than 999$!",@vinhvu155,1,2025-02-03T02:57:41Z,negative,True,False,,False,,True,negative,False,,False,,True,negative

Ugyvu9rPDHIa3UHWqNd4AaABAg,After 4 months of using. I noticed that 27w charging on my 9 Pro is really really slow. Start charging both S20 FE (only 25w supported-constant charging at 20w) and 9 Pro at the same 10% to fully charged. S20 FE is fully charged before 9 Pro. 9 Pro charging at 27w until it reach to about 60% then it hugely drops charging power down. Make it take almost 2 hours to fully charged (slow charging like my old Xperia XZ Premium which supports only 18w QC3),@KokoroShashin,0,2025-02-04T10:00:25Z,negative,True,False,,False,,True,negative,False,,False,,False,
UgyQIGd3NQKIxKbSrGh4AaABAg,"The fact they are not physical dual-sim phones is one of the things that make me hesitant. But really, in general, I keep hearing stuff that makes it sound like they slacked off on various aspects of the hardware while still charging flagship range prices... And it doesn't help the news that they've downsizing their phone departments and merging the software and hardware folks, kinda makes it sound like internally they're already planning on/expecting that side of the company to be heading to the shitter. I only still keeping an eye on it 'cause maybe because of Graphene might be the best option for privacy; got lotsa other models on my list that are pending researching some important details to decide if getting a Pixel 9 is worth the sacrifices and cost...",@tiagotiagot,0,2025-02-02T22:04:45Z,negative,True,False,,False,,False,,False,,True,negative,True,negative
