Below is the fully “annotated” CSV for OnePlus 12_Reviews.csv. In the annotation below I’ve determined an overall sentiment (positive/neutral/negative) for each comment and marked “relevant” as True when the comment discusses the phone (its features, performance, design, pricing, etc.) rather than just a passing remark or video‐editing note. For the designated aspects—camera, battery, performance.1, display, design.1, and price—I flagged “<aspect>_mentioned” as True only when the comment explicitly refers to that aspect. When an aspect is mentioned, I added a sentiment label (positive/neutral/negative) based on the comment’s tone; if an aspect isn’t mentioned the corresponding sentiment cell is left blank.

UgzClNPn9z6YwjfIFkR4AaABAg,"""Watching this with my OnePlus",,,,,,,,,
UgwPC9x5zyhEmsyS8hp4AaABAg,"""The real reason why this phone stood out to me and just changed my life is the charging speed. I became a oneplus believer in a matter of minutes", I'm not even joking. ,,,,,,,,
I am able to use this phone for 1-2 days and then then charge it back up with that SUPERVOC 100W charging in minutes, it's a super game-changer that I never knew I needed.,,,,,,,,,
I can literally just play some wild rift for 4 hours and get my battery down to 20%, then I leave it in for 5 minutes? It goes up to 50%. I leave it for 10 minutes? Okay now it's up to 80%! ...I leave it for 15 minutes on charge? It's back to 100%.,,,,,,,,,
It's literally crazy, I never knew this ultra charging is going to such an amazing feature... and Now I simply can't imagine a phone without it. ,,,,,,,,,

UgwyPTelNKvMK54XjZt4AaABAg,"""Glad the comments from the podcast translated into a review. Lol..",,,,,,,,,
UgyDwcceauMbWqLvo9l4AaABAg,"""I really appreciate you listening to your fans and making this vid.",,,,,,,,,
I saw a comment about bullying you into it, I hope you never feel that way, it good to understand what your audience want to see.,,,,,,,,
In any other year, I could understand the original thinking of skipping it, but oneplus really did something right here, and counting the oneplus open it's 2 in a row. ,,,,,,,
UgxuP4D9o__7Ag8uP6F4AaABAg,"""Glad you came around and finally did a review of the OnePlus 12. There was going to be a revolution if you didn't.",,,,,,,,,
Ugy50Edlp2EoXMkpyDB4AaABAg,"""IR blaster is the single most underrated smartphone feature and you can't change my mind.",,,,,,,,,
Ugwi9lxmN3HHNBdXBPl4AaABAg,"""Thanks for mentioning flicker and PWM.",,,,,,,,,
Ugzi5h0SMO55O5c5O4F4AaABAg,"""Ive had my OnePlus 12 for just over a week now", i finally upgraded from my OnePlus 7 pro, which has been fantastic over the past 5 years but degraded battery life and a broken screen ment it was time to upgrade.,,,,,,,
My first impressions are that this phone is fantastic in every aspect, performance, camera, battery life and charging speeds. ,,,,,,,
The last two are so good, here in the uk we get 100w charging and ive never had a phone charge so quick or battery last so long, 2 full days easy!,,,,,,,,
I also got a great deal getting a free pair of B&O headphones with it.,,,,,,,,,,
Ugw8rzqBp4VAvDyZmt54AaABAg,"""I have mine for a week now 16/512GB and it's insane.",,,,,,,,,
Best screen i have seen so far even the edges don't change that. The battery is crazy 16hours screen on time is no problem. 26minutes from 0-100%,,,,,,,,,,
Connection is good even at places where i normally have bad signal. ,,,,,,,,,,
Performance is typical for the snapdragon 8 gen3. Oxygen os 14 is also a big upgrade to oos13.,,,,,,,,,,
The camera is one of the best on the market. There is less after editing on the pictures so they seem less vibrant but very realistic. With pro mode it's perfect for nearly every shot.,,,,,,,,,,
Front cam is basic but it's good. Nothing special.,,,,,,,,,,
The speakers are nice and the rumbles are the best I've felt so far. Even better then iPhone haptic feedback.,,,,,,,,,,
That all and more for less then 800€ is a perfect deal.,,,,,,,,,,
UgynGmiNiRevSapai-B4AaABAg,"""I was just waiting for your review...! Thank you!!!",,,,,,,,,
