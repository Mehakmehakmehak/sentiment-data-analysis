UgzUlaHFINZenHFWpdd4AaABAg,I understand why most people aren't excited (there's moreso improvement than innovation this iteration) but I'm upgrading to the Ultra from an S10+ so I can't help be a tiny bit hyped üòÜ,@mellbellsringing,236,2023-02-01T19:28:24Z,positive,True,False,,False,,False,,False,,False,,False,

Ugw28krpTjCVEcKmXMF4AaABAg,I have skipped samsung for a while because of them using exynos in my region (europe) and Im very happy they decided to use the snapdragon in europe now for the first time!

UgxNEM1EDUBbfQHh6ZF4AaABAg,S23 Plus looks very fitting only because of the battery life.
