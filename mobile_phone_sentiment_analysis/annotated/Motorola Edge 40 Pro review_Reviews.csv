Much more than anything. look at the whole phone that it presents, not just at a camera that you can always replace with a much better performing one from a DSLR or mirrorless. a good camera on a smartphone really matters, but still, you can't judge a phone just from this point of view. the camera offered by the Edge 40 Pro is a good one.

UgyY1JezFc6XSBDainl4AaABAg,I really like this phone but I'm disappointed that it's only in boring black.

When you make the metal rails black too its another level boring,@michaelfedorsha8147,0,2023-06-23T00:23:05Z,mixed,True,False,,False,,False,,False,,True,negative,False,
