My 15 Pro Max (received mid-October 2023) still has 100 % battery health. But only because I'm a bit crazy regarding the charging. Meaning, I only use the 15 Pro Max between 80-40% battery and never charge it overnight, never charge it wirelessly or with MagSafe and last but not least, I even only use an old Apple 5 watt charging brick, for which I bought an extra USB C to USB A cable. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
