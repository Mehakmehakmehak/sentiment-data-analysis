UgwTXCx51bNRZkOfn0d4AaABAg,"Faster shutter speed for clearer action shots?  
 
Faster shutter might also help with the slightly over blown highlights if stuck in wide open aperature when in wide angle.  
 
The bokeh I'm sure at 100mm will suffice.  
 
I should get mine this week, super stoked as I usually only buy cheap cell phones.",@Liamitis123,0,2025-03-10T08:28:03Z,positive,True,True,positive,False,,False,,False,,False,,False,

UgxdglMTdm30_RhTxjd4AaABAg,Looks like the default photo is the interpolated high megapixel one. On the old 9T you had to change it to 48MP each time.
