The A-series lineup was honestly a really good idea when it started and seemed like a genuinely good deal at the time, especially for an entrypoint into the Pixel series. But as time went on, the phones have been getting steadily more expensive, creeping dangerously into flagship territory, and with how often the actual flagships go on sale for around or less than the price of the A-version, it's becoming less and less of a good deal.
