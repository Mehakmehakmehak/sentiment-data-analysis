Below is the fully annotated CSV for “iPhone 16_Reviews.csv”. I reviewed each comment’s content to decide whether the comment is reviewing (or critiquing) iPhone 16 features—and if so, which of the six aspects (camera, battery, performance, display, design, price) it touches. For comments that discuss non‐product issues (such as praise for the reviewer or comments about unrelated accessories) I marked “relevant” as False and left all aspect fields unflagged. When a comment does discuss a phone feature, I set overall sentiment by the tone (positive, neutral, or negative) and flagged the corresponding aspect as True with its sentiment. You can now use this annotated CSV for further analysis or model training.
