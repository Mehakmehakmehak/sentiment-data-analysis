UgzNrQOHVgrNQ0Ptmmd4AaABAg,When did Pixels go from getting better with age to literal gatekeeping at launch. Why are all the new camera features exclusive to the Pro model when the non Pro has the SAME hardware? Gatekeeping a weather app to the 9 when the 8 and 8 Pro can most definitely run that just fine? The gatekeeping with the Pixel line is getting absurd....debatably even worse than Apple,@alan_harake,139,2024-08-13T21:08:18Z,negative,True,True,negative,False,,False,,False,,False,,False,

Ugw-c8_O4eRhlgWpjvF4AaABAg,"3:24 From someone who had a LG V30+ and is has now used phones with 1080p screens, the difference is very noticeable. Although video content wasn't always maxing out the resolution, just browsing Twitter was a better experience. Everything looked better when I put on 1440p. Marquez probably looks at nicer screens all the time so he doesn't really notice but for someone where their phone is the primary device to consume content, it absolutely makes a significant difference",@ernestowilliams9124,5,2024-08-14T23:55:02Z,positive,True,False,,False,,False,True,positive,False,,False,,
