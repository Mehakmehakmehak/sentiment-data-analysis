UgwI161vV6MAU7AvPzJ4AaABAg,There's a weird ass freaking problem with A55. It will stuck on the software update page at some point. The device will not update unless you factory reset it. Usually it happens after 2/3 updates. It happened on mine at the march update. Why isn't Samsung fixing such a major issue?! Wtf?! Is this the brand value? And probably the poor quality exynos chip is the cause. That's why Samsung quiet at this.,@bongoosebondman7065,0,2025-03-28T23:16:20Z,negative,True,False,,False,,False,,False,,False,,False,
