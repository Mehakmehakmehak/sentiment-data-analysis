UgyV4gBV3sW_Xh0gX0t4AaABAg,XUkV3RsjGrs,@arkmark7182,"Dear Samsung,

I am writing to express my frustration regarding the resolution of photos uploaded from my S23 Ultra and S24 Ultra series devices to social media platforms like Facebook.

Despite the impressive camera quality and large resolution of these devices, I‚Äôve noticed a significant reduction in image quality once they are uploaded to social media. The photos appear much blurrier and lack the sharpness I see in my gallery. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating, as it diminishes the value of having such a high-resolution camera.

In comparison, I‚Äôve noticed that iPhone users do not face this issue, and photos remain clear even after uploading to platforms like Facebook. It would be great if you could work on optimizing the resolution for social media uploads, so users can fully enjoy the benefits of their device's camera without experiencing such quality degradation.

It would be extremely helpful if an update could be made that allows users to select the highest resolution possible for uploads to platforms like Facebook and Instagram, ensuring the images retain their quality when shared. Additionally, it would be fantastic if there were a feature that lets users select all photos in an album at once and convert them to the desired resolution, rather than having to edit each photo individually.

I hope you listen to consumer/user suggestions. I‚Äôm truly disappointed when I take great photos only for them to become blurry when uploaded to social media. With fewer users relying on Google Drive or other platforms nowadays, it would be great if your devices were more social media-friendly.

. I look forward to seeing future improvements.",2024-12-28T15:22:52Z,0,0,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra full review,GSMArena Official,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra,

I'm the type of person who don't upgrade often and will get an average phone just enough for me to use. But my A50 is just screaming for it's life now after almost 6 years of use. hahaha. So now that I have a little bit more money, I thought I should treat myself with something good. Just ordered it last night. Why not the new S version? Cause it's just too much for my use. And as I've researched, the new releases aren't really that much of an upgrade from S23. So S23 it is!

I like s23 ultra in every way but it does not support 7 years of update and since I am a long term user I will atleast use the phone for 7 years so if you guys say that s23 ultra has more features than s24 plus will also get more features from extra 3 years of updates which s23 ultra won‚Äôt get so s24 plus might get more features than s23 ultra in the future. And another thing is that s24 has exynos chip which everyone is saying that this year it better i don‚Äôt really know if it is good or not for next 7 years. And one last thing if i buy s23 ultra than will i be able to get its accessories in future like screenguard and etc and since it has a curved display will i get the proper screenguard stuff and all in the future??

Between the big battery, a screen that is more efficient than the S23+, and a very efficient processor, I am super happy with the battery life.

The pen is nice when I use it, which is rarely.

I could care less about processing power. I run the processor in light mode to get even more battery life.

If I had to pay for it, it would not be worth it. Since I have a peculiar cell phone plan, I love having this thing.",2024-02-06T04:59:45Z,1,0,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Review - 6 Months Later,6 Months Later,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra,

Btw are you going to stick with the s23U or upgrade to the s24U?

The s24u doesn't have a curved/edge screen which I dislike... do you know if there are any changes that are worth upgrading? Specs etc..

Thanks and a good technique whilst watching vids on bed/sleep time is to have your pinky stick out and hold the bottom of the phone too.. it will still drop but a whole lot less, and unless you're about to doze off and fall asleep you'll pick up another bruise haha üòÇ",2024-03-01T17:16:37Z,0,0,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Review - 6 Months Later,6 Months Later,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra,Ugx6-W_oTy99V6BpGpR4AaABAg
