Even the iPhone is smoother. \r\n\r\nDoesn't use the \"whole\" screen, other phones with the same size and resolution, apps and text go all the way out to the edge. \r\n\r\nCan't remove weather as well as \"search\" bar on home screen. Also, the search is not saved when using the search bar. If you close it, it is gone when you open. Oh yes all synchronization is active. Chrome works flawlessly.\r\n\r\nSupport is more than useless as you are linked back to the same page. The personalized one is just, \"unfortunately there is nothing we can help you with\".\r\n\r\nThe screen sounds hollow when you touch it, sounds like a very cheap screen when typing or scrolling. \r\n\r\nTakes ages to charge and not exactly good battery life. All other manufacturers are light years ahead.\r\n\r\nMissing \"Pocket mode\" the proximity sensor does not turn off the screen if you put the phone in your ex pants pocket. There are not even options in settings for this. \r\n\r\nThis is just the beginning! What is Google thinking when they make phones? Can only warn you all about Pixel phones. \r\n\r\nUser friendly I can not say that Pixel is. Have had One plus, Samsung before.
