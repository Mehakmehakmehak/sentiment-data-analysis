Was in a middle of a video call, tried to check time. The screen was On but tried swiping tapped on it doesn‚Äôt work but buttons still work we tried hard reset, recovery mode with mac while apple support was assisting us. (my housemates helped me)

phone was in a immaculate state, not even a scratch or never even got wet.

Paid for express replacement which they advertise 3-5 days will replace it give you a brand new one right? then now after i paid the holding amount same price for a brand new one, went to Australia Post ahead and deliver the old phone to them.

Then today i was asking for update they reminded me again yes, 3 to 5 days, then just 5hours ago they sent me a email bomb ohh hey were very sorry we don‚Äôt have any stock in whole Australia will send it by November 4th.
AMAZING Experience from apple.

it‚Äôs my first iPhone by the way always been a Samsung user but never had experience like this.

Edit: I'd also add that neither you nor the reviewer is aware of the ""Picture styles"" filter than anyone can choose when shooting.  So, if you prefer the fake over saturated look, you can get that right out of the camera with no edits.
