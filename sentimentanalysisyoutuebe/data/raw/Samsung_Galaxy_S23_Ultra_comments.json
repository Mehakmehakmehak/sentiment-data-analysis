The photos appear much blurrier and lack the sharpness I see in my gallery. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating, as it diminishes the value of having such a high-resolution camera.\r\n\r\nIn comparison, I\u2019ve noticed that iPhone users do not face this issue, and photos remain clear even after uploading to platforms like Facebook. It would be great if you could work on optimizing the resolution for social media uploads, so users can fully enjoy the benefits of their device's camera without experiencing such quality degradation.\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely helpful if an update could be made that allows users to select the highest resolution possible for uploads to platforms like Facebook and Instagram, ensuring the images retain their quality when shared. Additionally, it would be fantastic if there were a feature that lets users select all photos in an album at once and convert them to the desired resolution, rather than having to edit each photo individually.\r\n\r\nI hope you listen to consumer\/user suggestions. I\u2019m truly disappointed when I take great photos only for them to become blurry when uploaded to social media. With fewer users relying on Google Drive or other platforms nowadays, it would be great if your devices were more social media-friendly.\r\n\r\n. I look forward to seeing future improvements.","published_at":"2024-12-28T15:22:52Z","like_count":0,"reply_count":0,"video_title":"Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra full review","channel_title":"GSMArena Official","phone_model":"Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra","parent_id":null},{"comment_id":"UgzfA2v-coAOgMQtLaN4AaABAg","video_id":"XUkV3RsjGrs","author":"@ravenmccraig7645","text":"Well, this made me more excited!
