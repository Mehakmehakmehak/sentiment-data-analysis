UgzGjJFTIwhvLYi3-W94AaABAg,BS8x2TicxQ8,@TheMrlidman,"Pixel phone has one of the worst software and hardware I have used. 

Can't have individual notification sounds for different applications, and original sounds for apps are not allowed by pixels software. 

The number of ""clicks"" to turn off wifi, dial up, attach file, ect, is ridiculous much. Even the iPhone is smoother. 

Doesn't use the ""whole"" screen, other phones with the same size and resolution, apps and text go all the way out to the edge. 

Can't remove weather as well as ""search"" bar on home screen. Also, the search is not saved when using the search bar. If you close it, it is gone when you open. Oh yes all synchronization is active. Chrome works flawlessly.

Support is more than useless as you are linked back to the same page. The personalized one is just, ""unfortunately there is nothing we can help you with"".

The screen sounds hollow when you touch it, sounds like a very cheap screen when typing or scrolling. 

Takes ages to charge and not exactly good battery life. All other manufacturers are light years ahead.

Missing ""Pocket mode"" the proximity sensor does not turn off the screen if you put the phone in your ex pants pocket. There are not even options in settings for this. 

This is just the beginning! What is Google thinking when they make phones? Can only warn you all about Pixel phones. 

User friendly I can not say that Pixel is. Have had One plus, Samsung before. There is actually the setting possibility significantly better and a lot of clicking for the same moment. And that everything actually flows easier, Pixel bugs now and then",2024-09-24T05:55:21Z,1,1,Google Pixel 8/8 Pro Review: We&#39;ll Fix It In Post!,Marques Brownlee,Google Pixel 8 Pro,

An IR sensor would be useful, especially coupled with the camera which could display a virtual ""dot"" on the sensing  spot in the viewfinder screen, thus emulating one of those laser dot IR thermometer gunnzz, but with the potential of a more accurate dot. and automatic emmisivity adjustment by using  AI to identify the type of surface  being probed.  
Meanwhile a  thermistor sensor is  useless and mostly just reads the phone running hot all the time ...üò±",2024-06-09T23:53:32Z,2,6,Google Pixel 8 Pro Long Term Review!,Drew Lipps,Google Pixel 8 Pro,
