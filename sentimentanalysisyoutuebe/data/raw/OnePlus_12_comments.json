Been trying to find a android phone manufacturer that has a friendly user warranty for people here in the States, sadly xiaomi does not fall into that category, and unfortunately i CANNOT STAND Samsung Galaxy, or anything of the likes from Samsung. Also its very difficult to find a decent high quality phone that is roughly 6.3 inches in diameter. Google pixel 9 pro is an option but i dont think you can qualify it high quality phone when it performance specs are in the mid range area's compared to their competitors. Although Google pixel does have a USA friendly warrenty as well as extended warranty plans. Almost all other top tier android phones are not so USA friendly when it comes to warranty, as well as all of the phones are in the 6.7 to 6.8 inches in diameter range. Honestly this is really frustrating finding a phone that fits my needs. Might just have to go with Pixel 9 since it is the only other android competitor that offers a 6.3inch diameter phone compared to xiaomi. When hauwei phones were de-andriodified by google, that was a real sad day for people like me that owned android phones. Huawei hands down made the best android phones.","published_at":"2024-12-24T00:23:14Z","like_count":1,"reply_count":3,"video_title":"OnePlus 12 One Year later - BEST Value in 2024!","channel_title":"Drew Lipps","phone_model":"OnePlus 12","parent_id":null},{"comment_id":"UgzPeJMZhJtgSlwLzch4AaABAg.ACPiaKBVigpACPs70oCunF","video_id":"TQnZBpDTm24","author":"@drewlipps","text":"Unfortunately OnePlus doesn't have the best track record for customer service and long term support.

OnePlus has better UI and a less glitchy experience. Xiaomi has good specs and performs well but I found the phone only lasted about 2 years, and I believe it was a flagship (I'd like to say it was 8T possibly but can't fully remember). Technically it was still useable but the battery had degraded a lot, it just didn't last as long as I needed it to. I would say camera setup was very good and performance was very good but it then got pretty slow after a couple of years. I had a OnePlus flagship phone ages ago my dad gave to me as he'd only used it for a year before buying a new one, I think that lasted 3 years before I wanted to replace it, mainly because it slowed down, and the battery degraded a little (but not as bad as Xiaomi). My current phone is OnePlus Nord 2T and it was good for a while, but after 2 years started slowing down. 6 months later and I'm trying to wait as long as I can to replace it but my phone is getting so slow (possibly the latest Oxygen OS update caused this?). Battery is still good enough and gaming performance is still good. I've heard newer OnePlus phones have a lot more bloatware now. I think OnePlus is better overall and offers more consistent quality.  But by buying a Chinese brand, you're sacrificing the life of the device. whilst the specs are good on paper, they obviously had to cut corners to keep the price lower such as more glitchy UI (OnePlus is not bad for this), a lot of bloatware, and for most Chinese brands the battery degrades pretty badly.  I've had Huawei and Honor phones before and I did get them to last for about 3 years (ideal amount of time for me), they UI was pretty smooth and bloatware wasn't that bad, but this was about a decade ago so it's probably much worse now. I think battery degradation was again the biggest issue I had, surprisingly the performance was pretty consistent the whole 3 years I used these phones.\n\nIf you are short on money and want good performance for like 2 years, and if you could then save up for something better, Chinese brands are good for this. Otherwise, go for a better known brand for a more consistent experience and if you want the phone to last longer. Flagship phones tend to last a few years longer but obviously they can be really expensive now. I've heard both Apple and Samsung intentionally slow older phones down with updates (at least like 5 years old) in incremental amounts to encourage you to buy a new phone. I'm assuming other brands do this too but it's just something to be aware of.\n\nTbh I'm planning on getting Nothing Phone 2A Plus or Nothing Phone 2 next if it has a big enough sale. Just for the lack of bloatware and in the hopes that their phones actually last a good 3 years. The specs aren't the best for a mid range phone but I'm just desperate to have a phone that isn't rubbish after just a couple of years.

I had the 8T from 2022 when OnePlus had it on sale for $349. Positively LOVED  it because it had a flat screen (had loved my previous 7Pro but curved screen annoyed me). Although I had no issues with it, I bought the OnePlus 12 earlier this year and TOTALLY love it!  OnePlus had a trade in offer to take off at least $100 to $300(?) depending on what PHONE (even if it's NOT a OnePlus phone) you were sending in to purchase the 12. I sent in my (pristine) 7Pro and got the 12 w\/512g of storage. Check out if that deal still holds with the latest sales promo. I STILL have my 8T but I USE my 12 ALL THE TIME! Really am happy with it! Even got the 50watt wireless charger for it too!  It fast charges in 20 minutes! IF you get the 12 at the new sales price-you really won't regret it.

I got the Plus One 12 today and it's great! I wish I could find a better calendar and weather app. But the camera is just fine and the cell reception in my rural place is much much better than the S23U. Thanks for this video.
